        <h1>about me</h1>

        <p>I'm a writer, musician, amateur photographer, occasional artist, yoga teacher,
        British citizen, now living in New York City. I still drink tea consistently througout
        the day, but I also eat bagels three times a week, so I consider myself fully assimilated
        to NYC life.</p>

        <p>My first foray in building websites was back in the early 2000s, when I poured my
        heart and soul into a Geocities site for my teenage rock band. We never got as far as recording
        or writing any music, but we had a killer website.</p>

        <p>Shortly after, I studied IT at A-Level, and, shocked that formally studying IT was
        in fact nothing like building a Geocities website, I failed miserably, and concluded that
        the web just wasn't for me.</p>

        <p>Fast forward to 2017, when I stumbled upon Khan Academy's 'Hour of Code'. I enjoyed it
        a lot, so I dabbled further in the "Intro to HTML/CSS" course. I was hooked, and decided
        to invest time more seriously, so I joined Team Treehouse and began working through the
        Front End Web Development Track, where I learned more about HTML and CSS, plus basic
        Javascript, CSS Flexbox, Bootstrap, responsive design, Ajax basics, and website optimisation.</p>

        <p>More recently, I solidified my knowledge using resources at freecodecamp.org and codeacademy.com.</p>

        <p>I also recently completed the Practical Javascript course at watchandcode.com.</p>

        <p>Currently I'm working on learning more about php and MySql.</p>

        <p>What I love about coding is that it's based on language. I feel like coding draws upon
        my passions of both writing and art; the components of the web are like characters in a story,
        and the code is how characters live out their plot and tell their story to the reader.</p>

        <p>It's poetry, and logic, and problem-solving, and I continue to be excited and challenged on my web
        development journey.</p>

        <p>But no, I still can't centre something using CSS without researching it for two hours on stackoverflow.</p>
